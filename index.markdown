Hi There!

This is the is the site used to demo the Static Shock series for engi.fyi. This includes totally building a static site from scratch in Jekyll, customising it, and then deploying it to multiple static hosting providers. The providers that this tutorial will target are:

1. Netlify
2. Cloudflare Workers
3. Google Storage
4. AWS S3 and CloudFront

This tutorial will be five articles to start with, with potential to customise more in the future.

Welcome again,

The engi.fyi Team.
